## Abstract

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. My inspiration for this project came from [TailwindUI Commit Template](https://tailwindui.com/templates/commit). I have developed a deep affection for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), particularly when used in conjunction with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). In this project, I've taken the template originally designed for React and Next.js, as provided by TailwindUI, and recreated it using Svelte. This endeavor not only demonstrates my proficiency with the React.js library and the Next.js framework but also showcases my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies, as I only started using Svelte a year ago.

## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
